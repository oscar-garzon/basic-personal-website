            <h3>Quotes from The Manual by Epictetus</h3>
            <ul class="quote-style">
                <li>
                    Your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of wishing to be a general, a congressman, or a celibrity, desire to be free. 
                    And the way to be free is to let go of anything that is not within your control
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continually remind yourself that you are a mortal being, and someday will die. This will inspire you
                    not to waste precious time in fruitless activities
                </li>
                <li>Find satisfaction in following your philosophy. If you want to be respected, start by respecting
                    yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stop judging the things that fate brings you as "good" or "evil"; only judge your own thoughts, desires,
                    and actions as good or evil
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where our attention and affection lie, there too is our worship. Take care, then, where you direct your
                    focus, desires, and dislikes
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you understand that outside events do not touch your deepest self--what matters is your 
                    interpretation and reaction--you can use any circumstance to your benefit
                </li>
                <li>Trust fate, and trust yourself. Seek advice from the laws of nature, not prognosticators</li>
                <li>Here are some examples of illogical conclusion: "I'm richer than you, therefore I am more valuable
                    than you." "I'm more eloquent that you. therefore I am superior to you." <br>
                    The logical conclusions would be: "I'm richer than you, therefore I can buy more things than you."
                    "I'm more eloquent than you, therefore my speech is more polished than yours." <br>
                    A person's worth, after all, is not found in possessions or style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sheep do not spit out grass to show the farmer how much they've eaten--they ruminate on it, digest it, then 
                    display the results in wool and milk. In the same way, do not spew your undigested thoughts; show their
                    results in action
                </li>
                <li>
                    The whole point of learning is to live out the teachings
                </li>
